1)Hive is a data warehousing tool that allows users to query and analyze large datasets stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It provides a SQL-like language called HiveQL to interact with Hadoop data. The current version of Hive as of my knowledge cutoff (2021) is Hive 4.0.0.


2)No, Hive is not suitable for OLTP systems because it is designed for batch processing and is optimized for querying and analyzing large datasets. OLTP systems require low latency and high concurrency, which are not Hive's strengths.

3)Hive is different from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS) in that it is built on top of Hadoop and is optimized for querying and analyzing large datasets stored in HDFS. Hive does not support ACID transactions because HDFS does not provide transaction support. However, Hive can emulate some transactional behavior using features such as bucketing and partitioning.

4)Hive architecture consists of the following components:
Metastore: stores metadata about tables, partitions, and other database objects.
Driver: controls the Hive query execution and interacts with other components.
Compiler: generates an execution plan for a HiveQL query.
Execution Engine: executes the plan generated by the compiler.
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS): stores the data.



5)The Hive query processor parses and analyzes HiveQL queries, generates an execution plan, and executes the plan using the Hadoop MapReduce or Tez framework. The components of a Hive query processor include the parser, optimizer, compiler, and execution engine.

6)Hive can be operated in the following three modes:
Local mode: runs Hive on a local machine without using Hadoop or HDFS.
MapReduce mode: uses Hadoop MapReduce to execute queries.
Tez mode: uses the Tez framework to execute queries, which can be faster than MapReduce mode for certain types of queries.



7)Features of Hive:
Provides a SQL-like language for querying and analyzing Hadoop data.
Supports various file formats, including text, Avro, Parquet, and ORC.
Integrates with Hadoop ecosystem tools, such as Pig and Spark.
Can emulate some transactional behavior using bucketing and partitioning.

Limitations of Hive:
Not suitable for OLTP systems.
Query performance can be slow due to the batch processing nature of Hive.
Limited support for complex data types, such as arrays and maps.



8)To create a database in Hive, you can use the following command:
CREATE DATABASE database_name;


9)To create a table in Hive, you can use the following command:

CREATE TABLE table_name (
column1 data_type,
column2 data_type,
...
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS textfile;




10)DESCRIBE is a command in Hive that provides metadata about a database or table. DESCRIBE displays the column names and data types for a table, while DESCRIBE EXTENDED displays additional information such as partition information. DESCRIBE FORMATTED displays the metadata in a more structured format.



11)To skip header rows from a table in Hive, you can use the following command:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE table_name (
column1 data_type,
column2 data_type,
...
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS textfile
TBLPROPERTIES ("skip.header.line.count"="1");
The TBLPROPERTIES clause specifies that the first line of the file should be skipped.



12)Hive operators are used in HiveQL queries to perform various operations such as filtering, aggregation, and joining


13)Hive Built-In Functions:
Hive Built-In Functions are pre-defined functions provided by Hive that can be used to perform various operations on data stored in tables. They are categorized into different types, such as mathematical functions, string functions, date functions, conditional functions, and many more. Some examples of Hive Built-In Functions are COUNT, AVG, SUM, MAX, MIN, CONCAT, LENGTH, SUBSTR, and so on. These functions help to simplify and accelerate data processing tasks in Hive.



14)Hive DDL and DML Commands:
DDL (Data Definition Language) commands are used to create, alter or delete database objects like tables, views, databases, and indexes in Hive. Some commonly used DDL commands in Hive are CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and DESCRIBE.

DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from tables in Hive. Some commonly used DML commands in Hive are SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and LOAD.




15)SORT BY, ORDER BY, DISTRIBUTE BY, and CLUSTER BY in Hive:
SORT BY is used to sort the output data of a query based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order. It does not change the order of the data stored in the table.
ORDER BY is used to sort the data stored in the table based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order. It is used in conjunction with SELECT statement.

DISTRIBUTE BY is used to determine how data is distributed among the reducers while processing the data. It is used in conjunction with GROUP BY statement.

CLUSTER BY is used to combine the effects of both SORT BY and DISTRIBUTE BY. It is used to sort the data based on one or more columns and distribute the data among reducers based on the same columns.





16)Internal Table vs External Table:
Internal table stores data in a managed location by Hive, whereas External table stores data in an external location outside of Hive.
Internal table data is deleted when the table is dropped, whereas external table data remains even after the table is dropped.

Internal table is used when the data is exclusively used by Hive and should not be accessed outside of Hive, whereas External table is used when data needs to be shared between multiple systems.


17)Hive table data storage location:
The data of a Hive table is stored in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) by default.

18)Changing the default location of a managed table:
Yes, it is possible to change the default location of a managed table in Hive. It can be done by setting the hive.metastore.warehouse.dir property in the hive-site.xml file to the new location.


19)Metastore in Hive:
Metastore is a component of Hive that stores the metadata information about databases, tables, partitions, columns, and their properties. It allows Hive to access and manage the metadata information efficiently.
The default database provided by Apache Hive for metastore is Derby, which is an open-source relational database management system.



20)Hive metadata storage:
Hive does not store metadata information in HDFS because HDFS is designed for storing large amounts of data, not for storing small pieces of metadata. Instead, Hive uses a separate metastore database to store metadata information. This enables faster access and management of metadata information.
